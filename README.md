In Java, the client-server model is used for building network-based applications where clients communicate with a server to request services or resources. The client is an application or device that initiates communication with the server, usually to make a request for some specific data or service. The server, on the other hand, is an application that provides resources or services to clients by listening for incoming requests and responding to them accordingly. In Java, the communication between the client and server can be established using various protocols . Java provides a range of APIs and libraries to implement client-server communication, such as Socket.
